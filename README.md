### Image Comparison Slider
A handy draggable slider to quickly compare 2 images, powered by CSS3 and jQuery, forked from [CodyHouse](http://codyhouse.co/gem/css-jquery-image-comparison-slider/).

[Demo (updated)](http://github.ctmh.co.uk/image-comparison-slider/)

### Why?
The CodyHouse code is pretty much spot on, but while setting it up for a project I found it doesn't account for:

- Edge to edge comparison
- Text selection / highlighting on drag
- Some code quality issues

This fork addresses these issues.

### Thanks
Disable text selection plugin provided by [Chris Barr](http://chris-barr.com/2009/02/disable_text_selection_with_jquery/) with modifications by myself.
